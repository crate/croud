Environment Variables
---------------------

:``CLOUD_SESSION``: The session-cookie that is used to authenticate a user
                    against CrateDB Cloud. As long as the OAuth2 mechanism in
                    ``CROUD`` is not in place this needs to be set to simulate
                    the login. Copy the value of the cookie ``session`` from
                    the browser that has been used for OAuth on CrateDB cloud.
